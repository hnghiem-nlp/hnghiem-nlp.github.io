Iâ€™m a PhD student at the University of Maryland working at the intersection of **NLP**, **fairness**, and **causal methods**.
My current work studies how large language models justify decisions in **college admissions** and **content moderation**, with a focus on structured rationales, counterfactual evaluation, and bias auditing.

I collaborate across **NLP + HCI + causal inference**, building pipelines for data generation, alignment (DPO/KTO/GRPO), and explanation analysis at scale.
